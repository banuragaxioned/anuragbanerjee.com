Hello and thank you for stumbling on this. This, and the other future weekenotes, are a way for me to capture what I have been upto in the last week, my process, thoughts and reflections.

- Spent a lot of time trying to solve Engineering problems at workâ€Šâ€”â€Šranging from understanding how WAFs (Web Application Firewall) work, CDNs (like Cloudflare) and [how one might add more security](https://scotthelme.co.uk/security-headers-cloudflare-worker/) (and got a A+ security score on Synk.io), understanding more about HTTP headers and how to allow/block requests based on these.
- Went through a phase of wanting to signup for a few webinars / conferences and not ending up joining up any. Iâ€™m usually drainedðŸ˜« or distracted by the time these start at around 9â€“10 PM IST (GMT +5:30).
- Got the new [Dota 2 Nemestice + Battle Pass](https://www.dota2.com/nemestice), played around with that until I realized (again) that I should not play ranked games for a week or two around such events as it brings out so many players who might not have played in a while.
- Played around with SVG sprite generation, which was a mentally stimulating exercise. Set the tone for the week ðŸ˜‰.
- After around of month of using and seeking feedback from [Matter](https://matterapp.com/) (which I highly recommend), Iâ€™m still procrastinating on doing a deep dive into feedback that I have received and working towards addressing them. I was grateful that couple of my colleagues shared honest and direct feedback. Having that certainty/clarity of what I need to work on the most is immense and I want to start making steps towards them.

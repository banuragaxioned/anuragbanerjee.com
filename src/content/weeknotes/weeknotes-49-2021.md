### Weeknotes 49â€“2021

*   The [new GitHub project planning capabilities](https://github.com/features/issues) (currently in Beta) just got rolled out to our organization, so that has been something Iâ€™ve been playing around last week. Not as full-featured compared to Notion, but it does come across as a simple and practically useful way of managing your projects. Going to try and use this on an upcoming project.
*   Spent the weekend completing the [Applied Visual Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-visual-design), [Applied Accessibility](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-accessibility), and [Responsive Web Design Principles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-principles) over at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

*   Started working on a mini-project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Created the general layout structure and a single mammoth of a file. Goal is to get the structure and itâ€™s core components nailed down. Once that is done, I would split them into components, make the codebase more leaner and easy to manage (donâ€™t try to over-do or try to perfect things from the first iteration). This all sounds very obvious, but for reason, it wasnâ€™t as evident to me (or someone who hadnâ€™t see that in action before) and then I came across [Peter Meehanâ€™s tutorial on Gavin Joyceâ€™s channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg1qbkG0KRI) which helped me visualize this very clearly. Being able to build the core structure of your website/application in a few hours gives you an immense boost in speed and confidence. You can then start to see the ways to optimize and clean this up when you round up each section with a polishing touch.
*   Flexbox and Grids are cool! And when you pair them with Tailwind CSS, the whole process becomes so seamless and fun. Iâ€™m still a beginner, and coming to this after 15 odd years is surely helping me not feel too far behind.
*   I think I have finally gotten over Dota 2. Okay, not really. It is never that straight and simple after youâ€™ve spent 10,069 hours ðŸ˜‰ doing something for over 8 years. I finally have things around me which give me greater or close to same level of satisfaction as playing this game. Iâ€™ll still play this from time to timeâ€Šâ€”â€Šover the weekend or when I need something to distract me. However things will be different this time.

10069 hours = 420 days = 14 months = 1.16 years; 13% of my life since MarchÂ 2013.

*   Wins against AC Milan (2â€“1) and returning legend Steven Gerrardâ€™s Aston Villa (1â€“0) sees the Reds continue in all competitions. Football has been kind to us this year, unlike the last year which was ravaged by injuries. So far so good. Up the Reds!

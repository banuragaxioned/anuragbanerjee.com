### Weeknotes 42â€“2021

*   A week after one of the bigger projects that Iâ€™ve been part of for the last 8 months, around 2 years since the start of the conversationâ€Šâ€”â€Šit feels good. Something we got to cherish and enjoy. It is wonderful to see the vision come togetherâ€Šâ€”â€Šdespite some ups and down (which will always happen).
*   With getting some more time and mental headspace after the above project, we were able to start putting together foundations for our technical vision / roadmapâ€Šâ€”â€Šwith a special focus on automation. Putting together a core team now, a focus group to drive this and excited to see the work come together in the coming months.
*   Talking about mental headspace, this been a big oversight on my part in the last few weeks or almost over a month. I can feel the difference this makes. I need to manage this better in the futureâ€Šâ€”â€Šand not get overwhelmed and not give in as easily.
*   Been trying out [Sunsama](https://sunsama.com/) for the last week and I think it is growing on me. I like how it bring every tool that I use (for work or personal), from Jira to Slack to Emails(!) and bring it all into Google Calendar! At $20 a month ($16/month if paid annually), it is quite steep ðŸ’° and Iâ€™m still on the fence. Maybe Iâ€™ll come back to it at some time in the future or if there is a better deal. Letâ€™s see.
*   Resumed learning React Native on Udemy after over 2.5 years since getting the [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) by Stephen Grider. Better late than never.
*   Liverpool beat Manchester United 5â€“0 ðŸ”¥, at Old Trafford! Absolute madness. After beating Atletico Madrid mid-week, this was the cherry on the top. Mohammed Salah is in the form of his life, and is the best player in the world right now. YNWA!

### Weeknotes 47–2021

*   Had a creative burst of ideas (and motivation) in the last week and a half at work which I’d like to build up on. However, ideas are good and all but now it is time to make things happen — and that’s one of goals for the coming weeks, to make some progress on them (one at a time).
*   Inemuri, the Japanese nap! So, I was always a bit skeptical about naps in the afternoon — and to be very frank, not sure why; maybe it has to do with the gamer fad of “sleep is for weak”. However, I have turned this recently — a 20 min nap after lunch. I always ate super fast and be done in under 10 mins and often ended up going straight back to work after (only to be burned out by the end of the day). Tried this couple of days last week and it has filled me up with energy and also giving me time to do deep work after I get back from my nap.
*   A dear old friend of mine invited me over to Thanksgiving (Friendsgiving) dinner potluck, and had a lovely time over there. Seeing some old as well as new faces, being grateful of things we have, some board/party games and last but not the least great food!
*   Happy learning (with Udemy). Making the most of the Black Friday deals, I ended up getting 8 courses ranging from React & Next.js to Neuroplasticity. Mid-way through the Neuroplasticity one and this activity (weeknotes) is one of the habits that I want to develop and keep.
*   Liverpool won a resounding 4–0 margin against Southampton. Reds are on fire, having scored atleast twice in each of the last 17 matches in all competitions — the first English team to do so since Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1939; and also crossed 700 goals under Klopp! 🔴🔥
*   Lastly, I was really bored and fed up of working from home. Unlike some, I did have the opportunity to go to the office but I was craving a different kind of space — more personal, with solitude and away from my usual distractions. I booked a place for couple of nights on the other side of the city, closer to the sea and enough time in my hands to do anything that I wanted to (without the temptations of gaming).

Hello and thank you for stumbling on this. This, and the other future weekenotes, are a way for me to capture what I have been upto in the last week, my process, thoughts and reflections.

- Finally starting with weeknotes after (3) years of not getting around to starting this.
- Got around to making a jump into Medium for my personal blog. Not going to dwell too much on the platform (Ghost, Wordpress, Medium or some other new and shiny thing).
- Got vaccinated (Dose 1) and had a complete wipe out the next day.
- Dreaming of going on a solo trip sometime very soon. Need to make a small break happen.
- Tried to watch a bit of the Euro 2020, don’t feel that invested or interested in to be honest unlike the previous/other tournaments.
- Played around with Wordpress authentication (and authorization) workflow, reading up on what happens under the hood for a multi-channel headless architecture project that I’m working.
- Been a full week of using the [stoic. app](https://www.stoicroutine.com/) — pleasantly surprised. Wasn’t super stoked to find out that there is no Android-iOS sync and the lack of feature parity between the platforms. However, looking beyond all that, I’m happy with the state of the iOS app and would continue to use this. I’ll try to share my experience with using it at a future date.
- Binged Season 1–4 of Peaky _fookin’_ Blinders.
- Ordered some cold brew coffee packs from the lads over at [Sleepy Owl](https://sleepyowl.co/) — wakes you right up!
- Made me some Udon Shrimp noodles with cherry tomatoes at home. Definitely going to make this more often now. Placed a follow up order on Amazon to get another batch of ingredients delivered.

Not the most appetizing picture but I can vouch for the taste!

### Weeknotes 33â€“2021

*   Coming back to this after a few weeks of absence. There was a lot happening on personal and professional frontâ€Šâ€”â€Šand I was not able to keep myself accountable for a lot of things. Getting back into the rhythm now.
*   Finally got one of the projects thatâ€™s been my main focus for the last few months right to the finishing line. Looking backâ€Šâ€”â€Šit has been a learning experience for all involved and also reminded me of what I really enjoy the most.. building things together.
*   Working on starting a â€˜[Microsoft Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/)â€™ type initiative at work with one small project right now. So far so good. Will look at expanding that soon.
*   Spent the weekend going through Next.js documentation and trying to get my head wrapped around how it could help me and the team do things better, faster and more efficiently. Threw in Typescript and Tailwind into the mix as well. Something Iâ€™ll be exploring more in the coming weeks.
*   Not been a health conscious this week and added a lot of junk food into my diet ðŸ˜…. Will start again with couple of days a week of runs/jogs in the evening.
*   Been a good first couple of games for Liverpool with 2 wins as the Premier League is back with the fans. Salah, Jota, Firmino and Salah all bagging a goal each already. And our Big Virg is back yo!

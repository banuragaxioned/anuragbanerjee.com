*   This quote, describing _amor fati_ was just the reminder I needed on what and where should I be focusing my energies on. “Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it.” — Friedrich Nietzsche
*   Had a idea couple of weeks back around putting together a “State of x” report for things that I deeply care about. From workplace to my own personal self. The motive: an integrity check, an annual report for the year, and mix that up with Apple’s way of presenting keynotes. So, I have started with putting together some initial structure around this and will be spending the coming weeks to flesh this out further and bring in more people to participate in, especially at work/[Axioned](https://axioned.com/).
*   Trying out “Neither yes or no”. First one to say yes or no to something “loses”. I like the concept (though the applicability or relevance of this is selective in my opinion). As a leader, that forces me to check myself and focusing on letting the team make decisions. Only been able to practice it in a couple of meetings, but I left quite happy/satisfied from these meetings. Something to try more of.
*   The Reds had a good week with 4–1 win against Everton in the Merseyside derby mid-week and getting past a defensively solid Wolves squad with a late winner by the legendary Divock Origi.

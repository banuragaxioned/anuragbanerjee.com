title: Setting up Obsidian
excerpt: Coming back to Obsidian
---

After a year of trying Notion (again), I'm finally ready to give *Obsidian* a shot again. Spent some time this weekend wiring up the notes to be auto-published. Inspired by the work of many others, I did want to keep this minimal.

Being able to set these `zettles` to trigger a *GitHub Action* on commit, update the diff onto a separate repository that houses the *Astro* frontend, and then deploy on *Cloudflare Pages*.

I could set this up inside a single repository, but being able to push these `zettles` into a separate route on your domain sounded pretty cool. Of course, one can update the GitHub Action a tiny bit and make it all work in a single repository.

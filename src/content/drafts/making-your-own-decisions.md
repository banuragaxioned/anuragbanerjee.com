As growing up, this is something I used to often struggle with and frankly, still do. Making decisions can sometimes be a paralyzing experience — there are times when I would prefer someone else make the decision vs. counting on me. And on the other hand, it can also be a truly defining moment in your personal growth.

For me, one of the most thrilling experiences (that I actively look for) is being in situations where it is entirely on me to make a decision for myself — not to be influenced by opinions and to think of the consequences of that on myself (and things that I care about — my value system, which I’ll get into some other time). This is one of the reasons why I like solo traveling — you have to make your own move, on your own term, while being conscious and accepting of the external factors that you cannot control.

### Establish your core principles/value system

Be clear about what you value — behaviors,

### You make your choices

I recognize that this might come off very preachy if not utterly vague. I think we all get to a point in our lives when we truly know the meaning of “making your choices”. Growing up, especially in India, it has been something that a lot of people struggle with — when it comes to their parents, extended families, societies expectations and so on. You can chose to solicit advice from several, hear everyone out (friends, colleagues, people online) but the decisions should be made by you and you alone.

### Never implicitly expect things to work out

You might have to try something multiple times to get it right (only for the rug to be pulled from under your feet). It is okay to make mistakes.

### No ones to blame

When things go wrong or not as planned (as it often happens in life) you save yourself from the guilt or discomfort of realizing you should/shouldn’t have gone on someone else’s word. When you make your own decision and things don’t go your way, the only logical next step is for you to take note of how would you do things differently if you face a similar situation again. A friend once told me: ‘things don’t happen to you, they happen for you’. If you keep that in mind next time you come across an blip, step back and recognize that its happen for you to realize/acknowledge the room for improvement and get back into the mix.
